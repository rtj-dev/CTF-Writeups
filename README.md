# CTF Writeups Portfolio

Welcome!

I plan to use this repository to document my learning journey in offensive security. These writeups will attempt showcase my ability to identify vulnerabilities, exploit systems, and communicate findings to both technical and non-technical audiences, while highlighting my progress and passion for offensive security.

## Structure
- **Active-Directory**: Challenges involving Windows Active Directory, like RBCD or ESC1-16
- **Web-Exploitation**: Web-based vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Linux**: Linux-specific exploits and/or privilege escalation
- **Windows**: Windows-specific exploits and/or privilege escalation
- **Cloud**: Cloud security challenges (e.g., AWS, Azure misconfigurations)
- **AI/LLM**: Experiments with AI and large language model security (e.g., prompt injection), an emerging area I’m studying.
- **Tools.md**: A list of tools I often use, like Nmap, NetExec, and Burp Suite.
- **Resources.md**: Resources I often reference or use, including tutorials, blogs, and courses.

## Sample Writeups
- [Phantom (Active Directory)](Active-Directory/Phantom/Phantom_Technical.md): Exploiting SMB shares and escalating with Resource-Based Constrained Delegation to compromise a domain.

## Notes
- All writeups are based on CTF environments (e.g., Hack The Box, TryHackMe, PwnedLabs), contain no sensitive data and are typically "retired machines".
- Writeups will often blend CTF and professional pentesting logic, with the intention of practising the latter.
- I’m actively adding new writeups as I tackle more challenges and learn new techniques.
