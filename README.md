# CTF Writeups Portfolio

Welcome to my Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups portfolio! I’m hope to use this repository to document my learning journey in offensive security. These writeups showcase my ability to identify vulnerabilities, exploit systems, and communicate findings to both technical and non-technical audiences, while highlighting my progress and passion for cybersecurity.

## Structure
- **Active-Directory/**: Challenges involving Windows Active Directory, like Kerberos attacks and domain escalation (e.g., ADCS, RBCD).
- **Web-Exploitation/**: Web-based vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Linux/**: Linux privilege escalation and service exploitation techniques.
- **Windows/**: Windows-specific exploits and/or privilege escalation
- **Cloud/**: Cloud security challenges (e.g., AWS, Azure misconfigurations), as I explore this growing field.
- **AI/LLM/**: Experiments with AI and large language model security (e.g., prompt injection), an emerging area I’m studying.
- **Tools.md**: A list of tools I’m learning to use, like Nmap, Impacket, and Burp Suite.
- **Resources.md**: Resources helping me grow, including tutorials, blogs, and courses.

## Sample Writeups
- [Phantom (Active Directory)](Active-Directory/Phantom/Phantom_Writeup.md): Exploiting SMB shares and Resource-Based Constrained Delegation to compromise a domain.

## Notes
- All writeups are based on CTF environments (e.g., Hack The Box, TryHackMe, PwnedLabs), contain no sensitive data and are typically "retired macines".
- I’m actively adding new writeups as I tackle more challenges and learn new techniques.
